qt-webkit-kiosk
===============

This is simple browser application written on Qt &amp; QtWebkit. 

Usualy runing in fullscreen mode, but supports maximized and fixed size window mode.

This browser uses only one application window. So, no popups, no plugins in separate processes, like Chrome do.

Supports several parameters via configuration file: proxy, user-agent, click sound.

Also supports hiding printer dialog and uses default or defined printer.
